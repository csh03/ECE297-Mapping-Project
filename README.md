Mapping 101+4 is a geographic information system (GIS) that provides users with map information for cities all around the globe. Developed in C++ with the GTK graphics library. Map data is courtesy of the OpenStreetMap API. Mapping 101+4 allows users to view street names, points of interest, and transit lines, as well as providing directions functionality, similar to common GPS applications today.
